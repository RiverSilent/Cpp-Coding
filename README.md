This repository contains a list of coding drills and exercises that I completed while teaching myselves C++.

## Compiling the code:

All the programs have been compiled using the [C++ 11 Standard GNU compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)

The code can be compiled using the following command - 
```
g++ -std=c++11 <file_name.cpp> -o <output_file_name.cpp>
```
